React duration picker for mobile, inspired by Android number pickers. A live demo is available [here](https://flurmbo.github.io/react-duration-picker).

# Installation

Currently you'll have to clone the repository yourself from Github. I hope to add the project to the npm registry in the near future.

# Usage

```javascript
import DurationPicker from "react-duration-picker";
...
return (
  <DurationPicker onChange={onChange} />
)
```

# Contributing

Contributions and feedback are welcome. Submit bugs or suggestions as an [issue](https://github.com/flurmbo/react-duration-picker/issues) on Github.
