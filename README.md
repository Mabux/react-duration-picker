React duration picker for mobile, inspired by Android number pickers.

# Installation

Currently you'll have to clone the repository yourself from Github. I hope to add the project to the npm registry in the near future.

# Usage

```javascript
import DurationPicker from "react-duration-picker";
...
return (
  <DurationPicker onChange={onChange} />
)
```
