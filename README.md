React duration picker for mobile, inspired by Android spinners

# Installation

Currently you'll have to clone the repository yourself from Github. In the future I hope to add the project to the npm registry.

# Usage

```javascript
import DurationPicker from "DurationPicker";
...
return (
  <DurationPicker onChange={onChange} />
)
```
